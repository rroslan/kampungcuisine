# Products App Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

A complete Django products application for the Kampung Cuisine e-commerce project with the following components:

### 1. Models (products/models.py)
- **Category Model**
  - Fields: name, slug, description, timestamps
  - Auto-generates slugs for SEO-friendly URLs
  - Related to products via foreign key

- **Product Model**
  - Fields as requested: name, category, sku, is_published
  - Image fields: image_main, image_1, image_2, image_3
  - Additional fields: slug, description, price, timestamps
  - Helper methods: get_all_images(), is_available property
  - Database indexes for performance on sku, is_published, created_at

### 2. Admin Interface (products/admin.py)
- **CategoryAdmin**
  - Display product count for each category
  - Search by name and description
  - Auto-populate slug field

- **ProductAdmin**
  - List display with image preview thumbnails
  - Inline editing for price and is_published status
  - Advanced fieldsets for organized editing
  - Full image preview in detail view
  - Bulk actions to publish/unpublish products
  - Search by name, SKU, and description
  - Filter by category, published status, and dates

### 3. Views (products/views.py)
- **product_list**: Main catalog page with search, filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **category_detail**: Display products in a specific category
- **product_detail**: Individual product page with image gallery and related products

### 4. Templates
- **product_list.html**: Responsive grid layout with search and filters
- **category_detail.html**: Category-specific product listing
- **product_detail.html**: Product details with image gallery and thumbnail navigation
- All templates use Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling

### 5. URLs Configuration
- `/products/` - Main product listing
- `/products/category/<slug>/` - Category filtering
- `/products/product/<slug>/` - Product details

### 6. Management Command
- `create_sample_products`: Populates database with sample categories and products
- Automatically attaches sample images if available

### 7. Media Configuration
- Media files served at `/media/`
- Organized structure: `media/products/main/` and `media/products/additional/`
- Sample images downloaded from Unsplash for testing

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Multiple Image Support**: Each product can have up to 4 images with organized storage
2. **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Automatic slug generation for products and categories
3. **Publishing Control**: Products can be hidden/shown with is_published flag
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first templates using Tailwind CSS
5. **Admin Enhancements**: Image previews, bulk actions, inline editing
6. **Search & Filter**: Full-text search, category filtering, multiple sort options
7. **Pagination**: 12 products per page with navigation controls

## Usage

1. Access Django admin at `/admin/` to manage products and categories
2. View product catalog at `/products/`
3. Use the management command to create sample data: `python manage.py create_sample_products`

## Next Steps

The products app is fully functional and ready for use. Potential enhancements could include:
- Shopping cart integration
- Product reviews and ratings
- Inventory management
- Product variations (size, color)
- Advanced filtering options
- Import/export functionality
