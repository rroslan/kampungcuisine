# Template Fix and Complete Order Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Template Syntax Error**: Fixed the Django template syntax error that was causing "Invalid block tag on line 81: 'endfor', expected 'endblock'" in the checkout template.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing Cart Context Processor**: The `cart_info` context processor was not included in Django settings
2. **Broken Template Syntax**: Django template tags were split across multiple lines causing parsing errors
3. **Malformed HTML**: Missing opening/closing tags in template structure

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cart Context Processor
**File**: `kampungcuisine/core/settings.py`
```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                # ... existing processors
                'core.context_processors.cart_info',  # ← ADDED
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

### 2. Template Syntax Fix
**File**: `kampungcuisine/templates/orders/checkout.html`
- Fixed broken Django template tags that were split across lines
- Corrected malformed HTML structure
- Ensured proper `{% for %}` and `{% endfor %}` tag matching
- Fixed missing opening `<div>` tags

### 3. Cart Summary Template
**File**: `kampungcuisine/templates/cart/partials/cart_summary.html`
- Fixed the original pluralization issue: `{{ cart.total_items|pluralize }}`
- Updated "Complete Your Order" button to link to checkout: `{% url 'orders:checkout' %}`
