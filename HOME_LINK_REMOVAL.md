# Home Navigation Link Removal Summary

## Issue Description
The "Home" link in the main navigation was considered unnecessary since users can click on the brand logo "üçú Kampung Cuisine" to return to the homepage, which is a common web design pattern.

## Solution Implemented
Removed the "Home" navigation link from both mobile and desktop navigation menus while preserving:
- Breadcrumb navigation (kept as requested)
- "Back to Home" action buttons in specific contexts (like contact success page)
- Brand logo functionality for homepage navigation

## Files Modified

### 1. Main Navigation (`templates/base.html`)
- **Mobile Menu**: Removed `<li><a href="/" class="active">Home</a></li>` from dropdown menu
- **Desktop Menu**: Removed `<li><a href="/" class="active">Home</a></li>` from horizontal menu

## What Was Kept (Intentionally)

### 1. Breadcrumb Navigation
- Category detail pages: "Home > Products > Category Name"
- Other breadcrumb trails throughout the application
- **Reason**: Breadcrumbs serve a different UX purpose (showing location hierarchy)

### 2. Action Buttons
- Contact success page: "Back to Home" button
- **Reason**: These are contextual action buttons, not primary navigation

### 3. Brand Logo Navigation
- "üçú Kampung Cuisine" brand link still navigates to homepage
- **Reason**: Standard web design pattern for homepage navigation

## Navigation Structure (After Changes)

### Before:
```
üçú Kampung Cuisine | Home | Categories | Products | About | Contact
```

### After:
```
üçú Kampung Cuisine | Categories | Products | About | Contact
```
