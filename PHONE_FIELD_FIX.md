# Phone Field Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The contact form was missing the phone number field in the template, even though it was defined in the form. This caused emails to show "Phone:" with no value because the phone field wasn't being collected from users.

## Root Cause
- The `ContactForm` in `pages/forms.py` included a phone field (optional)
- The contact form template `templates/pages/contact.html` was missing the phone field
- The email template always included "Phone: {phone}" even when no phone was provided
- Users couldn't enter their phone number, resulting in empty phone values in emails

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Phone Field to Contact Template
- Added the missing phone field to `templates/pages/contact.html`
- Clearly marked as "(Optional)" in the label
- Maintains consistent styling with other form fields
- Includes proper error handling and help text display

### 2. Improved Email Template Logic
- Updated `pages/forms.py` to conditionally include phone information
- Only shows phone line in email if a phone number is provided
- Clean email formatting without empty "Phone:" lines

### Before (Problematic Email Output):
```
Contact Information:
- Name: Test User
- Email: test@example.com
- Phone: 
- Subject: General Inquiry
```

### After (Fixed Email Output):

**Without Phone:**
```
Contact Information:
- Name: Test User
- Email: test@example.com
- Subject: General Inquiry
```

**With Phone:**
```
Contact Information:
- Name: Test User
- Email: test@example.com
- Phone: +60 12-345-6789
- Subject: Product Question
```

## Files Modified

### 1. Contact Form Template (`templates/pages/contact.html`)
- Added phone field between email and subject fields
- Proper DaisyUI styling and layout
- Clear "(Optional)" indicator
- Error handling and help text support

### 2. Contact Form Logic (`pages/forms.py`)
- Updated email template to conditionally include phone
- Changed from `phone = self.cleaned_data.get('phone', 'Not provided')` to empty string
- Added conditional phone line: `phone_info = f"- Phone: {phone}\n" if phone.strip() else ""`
